<h2><a name="Prerequisites_AKA_quick_and_dirty_introduction_to_assembler"> Prerequisites AKA quick and dirty introduction to assembler </a></h2>

<p>
This is a short introduction to assembler. You will not learn how to
write assembler, just get an idea how a compiler transforms a simple
C function to assembler, just enough to understand the next section.

<p>
I assume that you are familiar with C, especially with pointers and
addresses. I use a simple form of RISC here, because I find it
easier to understand for an assembly newbie: RISC means that each
instruction is as simple as possible (so that execution is very fast).

<p>
Assembler is much simpler than C. It has fewer instructions and only
a handful of registers, the "variables" of assembler. This makes it
hard to express complex ideas, and even harder to understand those
ideas expressed in assembler.

<p>
The general registers have integer values, and their precision
(measured in bits, also called width) tells you how much memory
can be addressed through this CPU (there are exceptions, but let's
keep it simple, okay?), because you can get a value by loading
an address into a register, and then load the value from that address.

<p>
In Assembler this would look like

<p>

<p>

<pre> 	li $r1, some_variable	# load the address of some_variable into
 				# the register called r1
 	lw $r2, $r1		# load the word at $r1 into the register r2
</pre>
<p>

<p>
Assembler does not care for type safety, that's the job for your compiler.
Therefore you can just add two registers not caring if they hold numbers,
or addresses. This would look like

<p>

<p>

<pre> 	addl $r2,$r1,$r3	# r2=r1+r3
</pre>
<p>

<p>
Let's look at a simple C function now:

<p>

<p>

<pre> int add(int a,int b) {
 	return a+b;
 }
</pre>
<p>

<p>
and translate that into assembler. This looks like this:

<p>

<pre> add:
 	addl $v0,$a0,$a1	# v0=a0+a1
 	jr $ra			# jump back to where add was called from
</pre>
<p>

<p>
What are those v0,a0,a1? Well, they are other names for special registers.
On MIPS, you have 32 registers: r0, .., r31. But normally you don't use
them equally, but by convention r2 is called v0 and used as return value,
r4 is called a0 and holds the first parameter to a function, ... This
convention is called the Application Binary Interface ("ABI").

<p>
Also the register r31, which is called ra, has a special purpose: when
a function is called, this register holds the address of the next
instruction of the caller, i.e. "jr $ra" is just a "return" in C. Note
that "return" can return a value, but "jr $ra" does not. This is what
I meant by "simple": You return a value in assembler by assigning that
value to a register before returning to the caller, using two
instructions, not one.

<p>
Now imagine that a function calls a function calls a function etc. No
chance 32 registers would suffice! So, a few of them, called non-volatile
registers, are supposed to be saved by the callee, i.e. if a function
wants to use one of those registers, it has to save the original value,
and restore it before returning. Which register is volatile an which
not? This is defined in the ABI.

<p>
Where can you save the original value? That's where the stack comes in.
(Stack space is where you can temporarily store something.)
Another special purpose register, called $sp - the stack pointer, holds
an address which you can decrement, thus reserving stack space to use.
The stack sits in the main memory, so it is not very fast as compared to
registers. For programs, $sp is already initialised before the start of
the program; you don't have to worry about that.

<p>
Example:

<p>

<p>

<pre> 	subl $sp,$sp,32		# subtract 32 from $sp ($sp=$sp-32)
 	sw $r7,28($sp)		# store the value of $r7 to $sp+28
 	...
 	lw $r7,28($sp)		# restore the value of $r7 from $sp+28
 	addl $sp,$sp,32		# restore $sp
</pre>
<p>

<p>
Why $sp+28 and not $sp+31? Because $sp is a char*, and you need 4 bytes
to store a 32 bit register. Thus, by reserving 32 bytes on the stack, we
have space for 8 registers.

<p>
In this example, we reserved 32 bytes from the stack, saved the value of
register $r7 into that space, did something ("..."), restored the value
and freed the reserved space.

<p>
It is a good idea to write a simple function in C and look what
gcc does with it: Instead of "-c" to compile a C file, you pass "-S" to
write symbolic assembly code. This is more or less human readable and
you can learn quite a lot from it.

<p>
It is important for the next section to keep in mind that very simple
functions, i.e. not needing many registers, and not calling other
functions (for which you have to save the return address, $ra), you
don't need stack space, and you can then return in the middle of such
a function by inserting the return instruction ("jr $ra"). This can
be done with simple function in contrast to complex ones: Complex
functions have to restore values from the stack, and more importantly,
restore the stack pointer itself.

<p>
One last hint before delving into the details of QEmu: In QEmu's source
code, the term "assembler instruction" is often abbreviated by "insn".
This abbreviation is quite common when reading about assembler (for
some strange reason some people don't like words with more than one
syllable...).

<p>

<h2><a name="Portable_dynamic_translation_-_detailed_explanation"> Portable dynamic translation - detailed explanation </a></h2>

<p>
In the following, guest code means the assembly code which is to be
emulated, while host code means the assembly code which is actually
executed.

<p>
The dynamic translation is a complex process, which is made even more
complex by the fact that some basic opimization takes place at translation
time, too.

<p>
The basic idea is that for each instruction of the guest CPU, there is a
function which simulates that instruction. Now, when emulating the guest
CPU, we could call the function for the guest CPU's current
instructions one by one. This is called interpreting and that's what
Bochs does.

<p>
QEmu however is a dynamic translator, which means that those functions are
not called directly, but a sequence of (guest) code is translated by chaining
the corresponding functions (of host code). That means that prior to executing
those instructions, the according functions (without the return statement) are
pasted together. Evidently, if that particular code is executed more than
once, this method is much faster than interpreting, because there have to be
a lot less lookups, and also the overhead of function calls is no
longer needed.

<p>
Dynamic translation is a lot more complicated than interpreting, because
you have to change the compiled code on the fly. For example, if the
instruction has operands (like "add" has), those operands have to be inserted
in the copied code, at the right place.

<p>
Fortunately, that is exactly what a linker must do with the object files it
links together. If, for example, an object file contains a reference to
an extern int, the linker puts the address of the extern int into that
location. The object file contains a list of those locations together with
information what should be put there. We call those "relocations",
because the object code can be relocated where you want by changing the
values at these locations appropriately.

<p>
So, every (guest) instruction which takes operands, has a corresponding
function with references to extern ints (__op_param1, __op_param2, ...).
The program dyngen is then used to extract the relocation information,
and write a function (dyngen_code) which uses this information to copy
the compiled code and fill in the operands. This function is written at
compile time. It is called at translate time.

<p>
There is also the problem of jumps. This is why the guest code is only
translated in blocks. At the end of each block, the code must return
to jump to (and possibly - before that - translate) another block.

<p>
There is more to QEmu's dynamic translation: Some tricks optimize the speed
of the translated code, like not calculating unneeded flags. In order to
achieve this, QEmu breaks up the functions for each instruction into oplets
and introduces an intermediate translation, also known as 2-pass translation.
This makes it possible to delay flag calculation or to leave out some
unneeded calculations.

<p>
In the file op.c for each target, those oplets (op_*) are defined.
As stated earlier, the dyngen compiler writes a function, dyngen_code, which
can copy those oplets and fill in the operands, and which is placed in the
file op.h. However, dyngen also generates the file opc.h, containing the
opcodes for the intermediate "CPU" (i.e. numbers for the oplets), and the
file gen-op.h, in which there is a function (gen_op_*) for each oplet. The
latter functions are used to create the intermediate code for the oplets.

<p>
The file translate.c contains functions to translate the (guest) instructions
into the intermediate code (gen_*), and the function disas_insns (or
disas_{target}_insns), which reads the guest code and calls the gen_*
functions (1st pass).

<p>
The file translate-all.c contains the function cpu_gen_code, which calls
disas_insns to create the intermediate code, and then dyngen_code (2nd pass)
to actually create the assembler code which eventually gets called.

<p>

<p>

<p>

<h2><a name="Porting_to_a_new_host"> Porting to a new host </a></h2>

<p>
If your host architecture does not produce ELF files, you have to implement
an object file loader for that file format (find CONFIG_FORMAT_COFF for
a good example).

<p>
In configure, add support for your CPU (hint: look for the string "$cpu" and
adapt the lines for another CPU).

<p>
In file dyngen-exec.h, before the define of FORCE_RET, add defines for the
registers (AREG*), just like it was done for the other architecures.

<p>
Also in dyngen-exec.h, at the end, add a define for EXIT_TB, which is
typically just the assembler code for a return. Make sure this is as simple
as it can be: if this code uses the stack, it will be fatal (the compiler
will try to clean up the stack *after* the return instruction).

<p>
In exec-all.h, before the typedef of spinlock_t, add code for testandset,
which is an atomic equivalent to
	if(*p==0) { *p=1; return 1; } else { return 0; }
Atomic means that between the test of *p, and the setting of *p, the current
thread may not be interrupted (or, if interrupted, return 0;). If your CPU
is supported by Linux, you may want to look at /usr/include/asm/bitops.h,
the function test_and_set_bit. I believe that such short pieces of code
are unprotectable, especially if you don't copy them, but instead imitate
them (otherwise there's a legal issue: Linux is GPL, while libqemu is LGPL.
Don't you just hate it being bullied by lawyers all the time?). Test your
code! QEmu will run just fine up to a certain stage (on Linux: the calibration
loop) with a wrong implementation.

<p>
At the end of dyngen.h, add code for flush_icache_range, which should
invalidate your CPU's instruction cache. If in doubt, leave empty and hope
for the best. If you have a RISC processor, you probably have to find out
how to invalidate the cache, because most of RISC's speed comes from
aggressive caching.

<p>
In dyngen.c, you have to add some defines. Find the line
"#error unsupported CPU - please update the code" and add a section for
your new host. The only tricky thing is whether your compiler produces
ELF object files with relocations in RELOC or RELOCA format. The easiest
way to find out is to try both and then look at the code which dyngen
produced (op.h). If there are no relocations, you took the wrong format.

<p>
In dyngen.c in the function gen_code, add code to find the return
instruction (look for "#error unsupported CPU"). The variable p_start contains
the start of the instruction, and p_end points just after it. Your job is to
set copy_size so that p_start+copy_size points to the return code.
A good example is HOST_PPC.

<p>
Also in the function gen_code, add code to handle the relocations. Note that
you don't have to handle all relocations, as the file op.o will be linked
to libqemu.a, and you only need to handle the relocations for
__op_param1 and friends, and the relocations containing absolute addresses
pointing into the code.

<p>
In vl.c, before the definition of cpu_ticks_offset, add a definition for
cpu_get_real_ticks. If there is no CPU support for this, or you are too lazy
to find it (like I am), you can use this code:

<p>

<p>

<pre> -- snip --
 /* Derived from: "m68k updates #2" by Richard Zidlicky
   "crude hack to get some sort of rdtsc support" */
</pre>
<pre> 
 #include &lt;sys/time.h&gt;
 static int64_t cputicks=0;
 static struct timeval lastcptcall={0,0};
</pre>
<pre> 
 // assume 5 MHz Pentium, min 80 ticks between rdtsc calls
</pre>
<pre> 
 int64_t cpu_get_real_ticks(void)
 {
       struct timeval tp;
       gettimeofday(&tp,(void*)0);
       if (tp.tv_sec == lastcptcall.tv_sec &&
          tp.tv_usec == lastcptcall.tv_usec ){
         cputicks += 1;
       } else {
         cputicks=0;
         lastcptcall=tp;
       }
       return ((int64_t)tp.tv_sec*1000000+tp.tv_usec)*5+cputicks;
 }

<h2><a name="Remarks_AKA_my_experience_with_porting_to_MIPS_host"> Remarks AKA my experience with porting to MIPS host </a></h2>

<p>
In a lot of places, there were already stubs for mips, but a few modifications
were missing.

<p>
My biggest problem was the ELF code: first attempts only produced PIC
code which uses a global table. What I mean is this: Everytime there was
a reference to __op_param1 or friends, the compiler produced code like

<p>

<pre> 	LI r0, offset
 	LW r1,r0(gp)
</pre>
<p>
which means that a 32 value is loaded from the address which is in the
global table at offset, where offset is a 16 bit number, or in C:

<p>

<pre> 	r1 = *(int)(gp[(short)offset]);
</pre>
<p>

<p>
This is of no use, of course, as dyngen_code wants to modify the code
in question to use another parameter than __op_param1, and the address in
the global table would stay the same for every instance of that
particular oplet.

<p>
I played around with several assemblers, and tried to force gcc to
not use the global table, only to find out that it was IRIX' assembler
introducing it stubbornly, not gcc. At one point I had an object file which
did not contain code using the global table. Unfortunately this was
no longer valid PIC code, so the linker would not link it. I finally
gave up and implemented asm constructs for __op_param1 and friends.

<p>
As MIPS is a RISC code, which basically means that all instructions are
32 bit wide, and therefore cannot take any 32 bit operand, a register
can load a value only in two steps. That means two relocations for each
operand.

<p>
Next problem: IRIX' assembler uses RELOC *and* RELOCA. Don't shout at me,
it's not my fault. Therefore I had to make an ugly hack which copies
those relocations without addend (the RELOC type) together with the
other relocations (the RELOCA type) into a new place. The funniest thing:
the addend is not even used in my code!

<p>
The only relocations I had to deal with now were the calling relocations.
There was much frustration with trying to make those relocations
independent from the global table, but in the end I realized that this
is not bad at all: Those relocations (with the exception of op_jmp,
which is treated differently, anyway) are satisfied at link time (as
op.o gets linked into libqemu.a), so dyngen_code does not need to
modify them.

<p>
One word about the AREGs: MIPS has 32 registers, but according to the ELF
ABI they cannot be freely used. Some of them have to be saved explicitely
before calling functions, others are clobbered. This does concern us,
because we use compiled functions, and must play by the same rules. It
would only be different if we implemented all op_* functions as hand
crafted assembly code.

<p>
When I was trying to find out what is happening, I added an fprintf to
EXIT_TB(). *BIG MISTAKE*. Don't do that. An fprintf will almost certainly
reserve stack space, which clobbers your stack, because the code to cleanup
the stack never will be called. It is no help to use "return;" instead, as
this most likely will result in a "jmp .end_of_function", and we want to
strip away the final ret (chaining!).

<p>
Another mistake I made: I compiled op.c with "-fomit-frame-pointer", and
the rest without. This leads to wrong code! Try to compile every object
file with the same options until it runs, *then* try to optimize the
compilation process.

<p>
Speaking of optimization: Everytime I compiled op.c with -O0, almost every
oplet started by reserving stack space. This is not what I want, because
often, there is an EXIT_TB() in an oplet (meaning: return from the current
Translated Block to QEmu), which is just a return instruction. On CISC
machines, the return address is on the stack. On RISC machines, it is in
a register which is possibly saved on the stack. So this would lead to
segmentation faults because of stack corruption.

<p>
So I had to turn on optimization in order to avoid using the stack.
Fortunately, only moderate optimization is needed, because the oplets
are really simple functions using mainly global variables. Unfortunately,
gcc insisted on optimizing away simple assignments with registers s0-s7.
This was fascinating for me, as I thought that the optimizer realized that
the result of those assignments is unnecessary. After many hours,
I finally read again an email from Paul Brook, and understood what is going
on: on RISC processors, a jump is not immediate... it executes the next
instruction called the "branch delay slot", and then jumps. As dyngen
wants to strip away the jump, this is no good: we would have to strip away
the instruction before the last one! I finally found the gcc option
"-mno-delayed-branch" to fix that.

<p>
Hint: If you have a similar problem, namely that you do not know which
gcc option makes your op.o invalid, you might want to try to add "-daP"
to the OP_CFLAGS in order to get a bunch of files, named "op.c.*" which
contain output from the various stages in gcc processing. In my case,
the file op.c.34.dbr contained the reordering, and dbr stands for
"delayed branch".

<p>
I also had great fun with debugging all the time: there's no decent debugger
for IRIX but gdb, which seems to be a bit broken when it comes to pthreads.
The only remedy was to use extensive logging (to stderr, feels like Matrix)
which was better in the end anyway, because I used a few tricks so I
was even faster than single stepping interactively.

<p>
So, I was almost there. A few instructions worked already, but then
there was either a segmentation fault, or an illegal instruction, or even
a bus error. Never at the same time, though. Okay, googling again, I found a
nice tutorial about shellcode on MIPS. Shellcode is assembler code with one
restriction: it cannot contain bytes which are zero, because shellcode is
meant to be injected by some hackery (most likely a buffer overflow created
by a creative string, which is terminated by a zero). Therefore, shellcode
has to be compact, and has to deal with the total absence of convenience:
no libc, no nothing. And this tutorial contained an information I missed
before: RISC processors do have an instruction cache, which means that
quite a chunk of instructions are prepared to be executed long before they
are actually executed. Unfortunately, as a dynamic translator creates new
code all the time, this is not so desirable. Further googling provided an
API call on IRIX to flush that cache.

<p>
And then, QEmu started to work. Almost. A window flashed, but then QEmu
crashed with a Bus Error. A Bus Error means that there was an unaligned
access, i.e. a 32-bit number should have been read from an address, which
is not a multiple of 4. MIPS CPUs are quite picky when it comes to that.
The problem was in hw/vga_template.h, and it said it right there:

<p>

<pre>         /* XXX: unaligned accesses are done */
</pre>
<p>
The remedy was to rewrite those accesses using byte accesses.

<p>
What worked really well was to add disassembly: I just copied the respective
code from gdb (normally the file gdb-{your_version}/opcodes/{arch}-dis.c),
stripped away the gdb specific includes, added a prototype of
print_insn_mips to dis-asm.h and two lines in disas.c just before
the line 'fprintf(out, "Asm output not supported on this arch\n");'
This helped a lot as I really could use the "-d out_asm" now.

<p>

<h2><a name="Remarks_II_AKA_my_experiences_with_Solaris/SPARC"> Remarks II AKA my experiences with Solaris/SPARC </a></h2>

<p>
First of all, other people worked at the huge task to get QEmu running on
SPARC. To mention a few: David S. Miller, who wrote the first support for
QEmu on a SPARC host, Jürgen Keil, who evidently did much to make it
run after QEmu evolved beyond the working stage (on a SPARC host), and
Martin Bochnig, who worked a bit on it, and was optimistic enough to trust
me I could do it (when I wasn't; the AXi he promised me when I succeed sure
was helping a lot...). I am not sure who used Linux/SPARC and who
Solaris/SPARC, but sfter so much work already done, there were only a
few things left. However, not knowing anything about the SPARC architecture,
it was quite hard for me.

<p>
The two major problems were in my case:
- Register Windows, and
- which global registers can I use?

<p>
Register Windows:

<p>
As explained in the "Assembler Crash Course" at the beginning of this
document, a few registers - the non-volatile registers - have to be saved
before they can be used. So, the wise people at SPARC invented the
saving of whole sets of registers: Out of 32 registers, only 8 registers
stay the same all the time, and are therefore called g0-g7 (global registers).
The other 24 registers are divided into three categories: i0-i7 (input),
t0-t7 (temporary) and o0-o7 (output).

<p>
When a subroutine is called, the input parameters are stored into the
output registers o0-o7. The subroutine starts by shifting the Register
Window by 16 registers, so that now these registers become i0-i7, i.e.
the output of the caller is the input of the callee. The input and
temporary registers of the caller are hidden away, and the callee has a
fresh set of temporary and output registers. At the end of the subroutine
the output is stored into the registers i0-i7, the Register Window is
shifted back, and so the output is visible to the caller in the registers
which are now o0-o7, the same ones in which the input to the subroutine
was stored before calling it.

<p>
The shifting of the Register Windows is done by the instructions "save"
and "restore". These instructions have to be stripped away before the
oplets can be chained, so there is code in dyngen to analyze the oplets
in order to strip them. A few oplets, however, did not have these
instructions in my case, because they are so simple they don't need them.
I added code to not strip these functions.

<p>
Of course, there is more to it. For example, the "save" instruction takes
an argument, which basically says how much space would be needed on the
stack if we're out of Register Windows (depending on the processor, there
are only 2-32 windows). And you don't really have 8 input registers, as
the ABI defines i7 as the return address and i6 as the frame pointer.

<p>
I strongly believe that the inventor of the term "Register Windows" at
SPARC is a very funny person, indeed. If I ever meet him, I buy him
whatever drink he likes most.

<p>
Which global register to use?

<p>
You might have asked yourself why it is necessary to strip the "save"
and "restore" insns. Here is why: we want to be able to use the local
registers l0-l7 also!

<p>
I tried those global registers which were already selected by David S.
Miller, only to find out that QEmu crashed on my box. I then reduced
the #define'd AREGs to the minimum, 4 registers. Although I passed
"-ffixed-g1" to gcc, which means that gcc should leave the register g1
alone, it got messed up from time to time. I now believe that some libc
function just uses it without restoring it, but maybe I am wrong and the
ABI specifies this as a volatile register. By using g2, g3, g4 and
g6, I finally had a running system.

<p>
But not for long! Martin tested it and soon found that sometimes it does
not work. I now know why: I should have read the ABI! It's clearly stated
there: g1 is volatile. g5-g7 are reserved for the system! As g0 is
always 0 (as on most RISC machines, for a clean design), I had to use
l0-l7. Of course, for that to work, I had to tell QEmu that whenever a
translated block is executed, those registers are clobbered. Remember,
the syntax is

<pre> asm("some assembler" : output registers : input registers : clobbered registers)
</pre>
As on SPARC, the translated block is called via assembly anyway (see
cpu-exec.c), this was easy.

<p>
What helped me most in the course of getting QEmu running on SPARC, was
forcing it to single step (in target-i386/translate.c, I just made the
"if" checking for "cflags & CF_SINGLE_INSN" succeed always), and then run
it with "-d in_asm,cpu". After the crashes, I compared the output in
/tmp/qemu.log with that of a running QEmu on another machine, and soon
found which register was clobbered.
