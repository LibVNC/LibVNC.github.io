      <h1>Introduction</h1>

      <div class="center" id="proj_desc">
        <p><b>LibVNCServer/LibVNCClient</b> are cross-platform C
        libraries that allow you to easily implement VNC server or
        client functionality in your program. If you don't know VNC
        and what it's good for, read about it <a href=
        "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Network_Computing">here</a>.<br />

        <br />
        See the <a href="doc/html/index.html">documentation</a> for
        an API reference, the <a href="#building">build howto</a>
        for info on how to compile the libraries on your platform
        and the <a href="#news">project news</a> for a list of
        recent changes.</p>
      </div><br />

      <p>To give an example, the simplest server looks like
      this:<br />
      <br /></p>
      <pre class="code">
#include &lt;rfb/rfb.h&gt;

int main(int argc,char** argv)
{
  rfbScreenInfoPtr server=rfbGetScreen(&amp;argc,argv,400,300,8,3,4);
  server-&gt;frameBuffer=malloc(400*300*4);
  rfbInitServer(server);
  rfbRunEventLoop(server,-1,FALSE);
  return(0);
}

</pre>

      <p>This sample creates a 400x300 frame buffer in true colour.
      There are 4 bytes per pixel, because 3 (which are only used
      instead of all 4) is such an odd number. Then the server is
      initialized and a blocking event loop is started.</p>

      <p>Of course, this program only shows rubbish (whatever is in
      the frame buffer you malloc'd) and does not do any error
      checking at all, but it proves that writing a server can be
      very easy.</p>

      <p>For more in-depth information (especially if you want to
      write a real <a href=
      "doc/html/libvncserver_doc.html">server</a> or <a href=
      "doc/html/libvncclient_doc.html">client</a>) look into the
      provided <a href="doc/html/examples.html">examples</a> and

    <h3>2016/12/30</h3>

     <div class=indent>
	<br/>
	<b>LibVNCServer 0.9.11 released!</b><br />
      <br />

      After quite some time finally a major release featuring continous integration to make sure the code builds on all supported platforms.
      LibVNCClient saw a lot of robustness fixes making it more stable when dealing with broken or malicious servers. LibVNCServer received WebSocket improvements,
      its built-in webserver got more secure and systemd support was added.

  <br />

      <br />

      Grab it <a href=
      "https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver/releases">
      here</a>.<br />

      <br />
     </div>

    <h3>2014/10/21</h3>

     <div class=indent>
	<br/>
	<b>LibVNCServer 0.9.10 released!</b><br />
      <br />

      Another major release that saw a massive code re-organisation, merged some Debian patches, addressed some security issues and fixed building on Windows 8.

  <br />

      <br />

      As always, you can get it <a href=
      "https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver/releases">
      here</a>.<br />

   <h3>2012/05/04</h3>
     <div class=indent>
	<br/>
	<b>LibVNCServer 0.9.9 released!</b><br />
      <br />
      This is a major release that contains numerous bugfixes and a nice bag of shiny new features, mainly full IPv6 support, the new TurboVNC encoder and support for WebSockets.
      <br />

      <br />

      You can get it <a href=
      "https://github.com/LibVNC/libvncserver/releases">
      here</a>.<br />

      <br />


Besides the fixed bugs, the cool stuff is:<br />
<br />

- Overall changes:<br />
<ul>
 <li>Added <a href="http://kanaka.github.com/noVNC/">noVNC HTML5 VNC viewer</a> connect possibility
to our http server. Pure JavaScript, no Java plugin required anymore! (But a
recent browser...) </li>
 <li>Added a GTK+ VNC viewer example. </li>
</ul>

- LibVNCServer/LibVNCClient:
<ul>

 <li>Added support to build for Google Android. </li>
 <li>Complete IPv6 support in both LibVNCServer and LibVNCClient. </li>
</ul>


- LibVNCServer:
<ul>
 <li>Split two event-loop related functions out of the rfbProcessEvents() mechanism.
This is required to be able to do proper event loop integration with Qt. Idea was
taken from Vino's libvncserver fork.</li>
 <li>Added <a href="http://wiki.qemu.org/VNC_Tight_PNG">TightPNG</a> encoding support. Like the
original Tight encoding, this still uses JPEG, but ZLIB encoded rects are encoded
with PNG here.</li>
 <li>Added suport for serving VNC sessions through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket">WebSockets</a>, a web technology providing for multiplexing
bi-directional, full-duplex communications channels over a single TCP connection.</li>
 <li>Support connections from the Mac OS X built-in VNC client to LibVNCServer
instances running with no password.</li>
 <li>Replaced the Tight encoder with a <a href="http://www.virtualgl.org/pmwiki/uploads/About/tighttoturbo.pdf">TurboVNC</a> one which is tremendously faster in most
cases, especially with high-color video or 3D workloads.
</li>
</ul>

- LibVNCClient:
<ul>
 <li>Added support to only listen for reverse connections on a specific IP address.</li>
 <li>Support for using OpenSSL instead of GnuTLS. This could come in handy on embedded
devices where only this TLS implementation is available.</li>
 <li>Added support to connect to UltraVNC Single Click servers.</li>
</ul>


<br /><br />
A hearty thanks to all that contributed!

   <h3>2011/11/09</h3>
     <div class=indent>
	<br/>
	<b>LibVNCServer 0.9.8.2 released!</b><br />
      <br />
      This is a maintenance release that fixes a regression in libvncclient that crept in with Apple Remote Desktop support added with 0.9.8. Viewers that were not
	adapted to the new functionality would fail connecting to ARD servers before.
      <br />

      <br />
      To keep the story short, this is what's new:<br />
      <br />
      Overall changes:

      <ul>
        <li>Automagically generated API documentation using
        doxygen.</li>

        <li>Added support for pkg-config.</li>

        <li>Fixed Mingw32 cross compilation.</li>

        <li>Fixed CMake build system.</li>
      </ul>LibVNCServer/LibVNCClient:

      <ul>
        <li>All files used by _both_ LibVNCServer and LibVNCClient
        were put into a 'common' directory, reducing code
        duplication.</li>

        <li>Implemented xvp VNC extension.</li>

        <li>Updated minilzo library used for Ultra encoding to ver
        2.04. According to the minilzo README, this brings a
        significant speedup on 64-bit architechtures.</li>
      </ul>
      
      LibVNCServer:

      <ul>
        <li>Thread safety for ZRLE, Zlib, Tight, RRE, CoRRE and
        Ultra encodings. This makes all VNC encodings safe to use
        with a multithreaded server.</li>

        <li>A DisplayFinishedHook for LibVNCServer. If set, this
        hook gets called just before rfbSendFrameBufferUpdate()
        returns.</li>

        <li>Fix for tight security type for RFB 3.8 in TightVNC
        file transfer (Debian Bug #517422).</li>
      </ul>LibVNCClient:

      <ul>
        <li>Unix sockets support.</li>

        <li>Anonymous TLS security type support.</li>

        <li>VeNCrypt security type support.</li>

        <li>MSLogon security type support.</li>

        <li>ARD (Apple Remote Desktop) security type support.</li>

        <li>UltraVNC Repeater support.</li>

        <li>A new FinishedFrameBufferUpdate callback that is
        invoked after each complete framebuffer update.</li>

        <li>A new non-forking listen (reverse VNC) function that
        works under Windows.</li>

        <li>IPv6 support. LibVNCClient is now able to connect to
        IPv6 VNC servers.</li>

        <li>IP QoS support. This enables setting the DSCP/Traffic
        Class field of IP/IPv6 packets sent by a client. For
        example starting a client with -qosdscp 184 marks all
        outgoing traffic for expedited forwarding. Implementation
        for Win32 is still a TODO, though.</li>

        <li>Fixed hostname resolution problems under Windows.</li>
      </ul>SDLvncviewer

      <ul>
        <li>Is now resizable and can do key repeat, mouse wheel
        scrolling and clipboard copy and paste.</li>
      </ul>LinuxVNC:

      <ul>
        <li>Fix for no input possible because of ctrl key being
        stuck. Issue was reported as Debian bug #555988.</li>
      </ul><br />
      Thanks to all that contributed!<br />

      </div>

      <h3>2010/11/29</h3>

      <p>LibVNCServer/LibVNCClient now have a new website (inspired
      by the FFmpeg one) including <a href=
      "doc/html/index.html">API documentation.</a></p>

      <h3>2005/09/29</h3>

      <p>LibVNCServer now sports a brand new method to extend the
      protocol, thanks to Rohit Kumar! He also extended the library
      to support RFB 3.7. Furthermore, he contributed TightVNC file
      transfer protocol support to LibVNCServer!</p>

      <h3>2005/05/25</h3>

      <p>LibVNCClient now features ZRLE decoding!</p>

      <h3>2005/05/15</h3>

      <p>Another round of valgrinding completed. This time it is
      augmented by changes instigated by using Linus' sparse. In
      the course, the complete sources were converted to ANSI
      C.</p>

      <h3>2005/05/07</h3>

      <p>The member socketInitDone was renamed to socketState, and
      no longer contains a bool value. This allows us to quit a
      server cleanly from the event loop via rfbShutdownServer(),
      so that the structures can be cleaned up properly. This is
      demonstrated in examples/example.c.</p>

      <h3>2005/01/21</h3>

      <p>The function rfbMakeMaskFromAlphaSource() applies a
      Floyd-Steinberg dither to approximate a binary mask from a
      cursor with alpha channel. A demonstration can be found in
      test/cursortest.c.</p>

      <h3>2005/01/16</h3>

      <p>Renamed this page to reflect that LibVNCClient is actually
      very usable.</p>

      <h3>2005/01/16</h3>

      <p>Karl Runge has done awesome work to support cursors with
      alpha blending! You can try it with x11vnc as in CVS, or wait
      a few more days for x11vnc to be released officially!</p>

      <h3>2005/01/15</h3>

      <p>Happy new year! It begins with a new macro recorder based
      on LibVNCServer/LibVNCClient using perl as script language.
      The macro recorder is itself written in perl, and writes out
      perl scripts, acting as a VNC proxy, so that you can connect
      a vncviewer to it, and it records all your input, possibly
      looking for a certain button, image, word, etc. before
      continuing. I called it VisualNaCro, and it's in CVS.</p>

      <h3>2004/12/20</h3>

      <p>Just before christmas, a new release! Version 0.7 brings
      you the first non-beta of LibVNCServer...</p>

      <h3>2004/12/02</h3>

      <p>Finally MinGW32 support. I only had problems with a
      vncviewer which wouldn't connect to localhost: I use
      SDLvncviewer...</p>

      <h3>2004/12/01</h3>

      <p>LibVNCClient is getting better and better... Expect a very
      powerful client soon!</p>

      <h3>2004/10/16</h3>

      <p>LibVNCServer has automated test, thanks to LibVNCClient
      (included). It doesn't do ZRLE yet, and exposed some bugs,
      the only remaining of these is CoRRE (not sure yet if it's a
      bug in the client or the server).</p>

      <h3>2004/09/14</h3>

      <p>Added <a href="success.html">Success stories</a>.</p>

      <h3>2004/09/07</h3>

      <p>The API was cleaned up. The structures and functions now
      have a prefix (mostly "rfb", sometimes "zrle" or "sra") in
      order not to clutter the namespace, while the structure's
      members don't need such a prefix.</p>

      <h3>2004/08/17</h3>

      <p>I finally came around to fix mouse behaviour in QEMU's VNC
      frontend for Windows 98. Please find the patch <a href=
      "oldstuff/qemu/">here</a>. If
      mouse behaves strangely, try to wiggle the pointer to a free
      spot on the desktop, hit Ctrl+Shift and release them. After
      that, the mouse should behave nicely.</p>

      <h3>2004/06/07</h3>

      <p>After silently being added almost a year ago,
      libvncclient's API was modified for real use, and three
      examples were added: ppmtest (a very simple demo),
      SDLvncviewer, and vnc2mpg (which lets you record your VNC
      session to a movie). Automated regression tests of the
      libraries are planned.</p>

      <h3>2004/06/02</h3>

      <p><a href=
      "http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/">x11vnc</a>-0.6.1 was
      released! This reflects the long way the original, small
      example has gone, improved in many possible ways and having a
      broad user base.</p>

      <h3>2004/05/29</h3>

      <p>Some <a href=
      "oldstuff/qemu/">patches</a> were
      created for <a href="http://qemu.org/">QEMU</a>, a FAST!
      emulator by Fabrice Bellard, to control those sessions with a
      vncviewer.</p>

      <h3>2004/02/29</h3>

      <p>LibVNCServer is listed as a project using <a href=
      "http://valgrind.org/">Valgrind</a>!</p>

      <h3>2003/11/07</h3>

      <p>Version 0.6 is out! x11vnc performance boosts! You no
      longer need a c++ compiler in order to have ZRLE coding!
      LinuxVNC was added (This is to the text console what x11vnc
      is to X11)!</p>

      <h3>2003/02/21</h3>

      <p>rdp2vnc is in rdesktop's CVS.</p>

      <h3>2003/02/19</h3>

      <p>A preliminary patch for rdesktop (CVS) to make rdp2vnc, a
      translator from Windows Terminal Server's protocol to VNC's
      protocol, is <a href=
      "rdesktop-cvs+vnc.diff.gz">available</a>. It needs a new
      version of libvncserver; try CVS until I release 0.6.</p>

      <h3>2003/02/09</h3>

      <p>Version 0.5 is out! Features include autoconf based
      configure, rpm package (YMMV), cleanup of directory
      structure, NEW x11vnc! ZRLE encoding! HTTP tunnelling through
      LibVNCServer's HTTP support! Many bug fixes!</p>

      <h3>2002/07/28</h3>

      <p>Version 0.4 is out! Biggest feature: NewFB encoding. Quite
      a few bugfixes also (Thanks to all!).</p>

      <h3>2001/12/14</h3>

      <p>A new version of <a href=
      "rdesktop-1.1.0+vnc-0.2.tar.gz">rdesktop+vnc</a> is
      available! (Includes support for other platforms keyboard
      mapping with plain rdesktop!)</p>

      <h3>2001/10/23</h3>

      <p>Added a link to my homepage at the end.</p>

      <h3>2001/10/18</h3>

      <p>I released the rdp2vnc extensions as well as patches for
      general keyboard handling, working inside Xvnc and
      process_text2 (the famous "font:" error) to rdesktop. Please
      find it on the <a href=
      "http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=32584">
      download page</a>.</p>

      <h3>2001/10/13</h3>

      <p>A snapshot of <a href=

      <h1><a name="building" id="building"></a>How to Build</h1>

      <h3>The prerequisites:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>The usual C compiler with headers and stuff.</li>

        <li>For the more advanced VNC encodings: <a href=
        "http://www.zlib.net/">zlib</a> and <a href=
        "http://www.ijg.org/">libjpeg</a> development
